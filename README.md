# Admission-helper

## About 
An app to help people apply for admissions on schools/hostels

This app is a rewrite of [Admission-helper-beta-v5.8.9](./origin-app/Admission-helper-beta-v5.8.9.ipynb)
and I imporved it. to use a GUI front end

I made this [app](./origin-app/Admission-helper-beta-v5.8.9.ipynb) when I was still learning object oriented python. so don't make fun of [this](./origin-app/Admission-helper-beta-v5.8.9.ipynb)
